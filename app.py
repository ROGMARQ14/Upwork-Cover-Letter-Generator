**The 7-Step Proposal System**

**Step 1: Personalize Your Hook and Twist**
The first line must grab attention (hook) and show you understand the deeper problem (twist). Avoid generic templates. Research the client's name if possible. The twist shows *why* they need the job done. Example: A client doesn't just need images; they need sales.

**Step 2: Save the Day**
Introduce yourself as the solution *after* the hook. Keep it client-focused (90% them, 10% you). Be short and sweet.

**Step 3: Establish Authority with Social Proof**
Use short, powerful snippets from your best client reviews. Keep them relevant to the client's industry. Maximum of three.

**Step 4: Showcase Results, Not Just Examples**
Demonstrate tangible results. Use relevant case studies. Don't just send a portfolio link; explain the context and the impact (e.g., "doubled conversion").

**Step 5: Guide the Client with a Call to Action (CTA)**
Tell the client exactly what to do next. Be explicit and personalize it. Example: "To get started, just click the green 'Accept' button, John."

**Step 6: Leverage the Power of the "P.S."**
Most people read the P.S. first. Use it to reinforce your message, create urgency, add a secondary CTA, or provide an extra personalized thought (e.g., "P.S. I looked at your competitor and have some ideas...").

**Step 7: The Final Action**
Send it. Trust the system.
