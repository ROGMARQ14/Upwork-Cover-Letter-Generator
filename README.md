- Some job postings may have different HTML structures
- Use the manual entry option as a backup

**API Errors**
- OpenAI: Check your usage limits and billing

**Secrets Not Detected**

## Tips for Best Results üí°

1. **Use specific job URLs**: Direct job posting URLs work best
2. **Review extracted details**: Always check and refine the extracted job information
3. **Choose the right model**: Different models have different strengths
4. **Stay under 250 words**: Longer proposals perform worse on Upwork
5. **Personalize further**: Use the generated letter as a base, then add personal touches
6. **Check the debug section**: Use it to troubleshoot any configuration issues
